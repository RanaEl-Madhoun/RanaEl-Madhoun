### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Computer Engineer** and  **Mobile Developer** . I thrive on building performant and beautiful cross-platform applications using **Flutter & Dart**.

My engineering background fuels my curiosity to not just *how* things work, but *why*. I love exploring different corners of the tech field, from low-level system architecture and embedded systems to modern UI/UX design and cloud infrastructure.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a fitness app with a focus on custom animations**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Kotlin for Android native development and diving deeper into Firebase**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source Flutter packages or impactful mobile projects**.
- 💬 Ask me about **Flutter, Dart, Firebase, and how to structure a scalable mobile app**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a robot that could solve a Rubik's Cube! 🤖
